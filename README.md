<h3 align="center">Neighborhood Service Web App - Backend</h3>

The Neighborhood Services App is a platform that connects people with local side jobs, like babysitting, pet care, or lawn mowing. The backend, built with a REST API and a microservices architecture using Spring Boot, is designed to work seamlessly with the frontend, creating a smooth and functional website experience.

This service is all about providing opportunities for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, or age, to earn money and help their neighborhood. Itâ€™s aimed at those who may need a financial boost or are looking for a fresh start, giving them the chance to contribute to their community while improving their own lives. The app makes it easy for people to find work, apply for jobs, and make a real impact in their local area.
